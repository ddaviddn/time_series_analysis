**README**
-------------------------------------
For this particular notebook, I ran through a in-depth exploratory data analysis, going through days and months 

with highest number of sales. Find seasonality trends, using transformations, PACF in order to help use for our

LSTM model (PACF will help us find a statistically significant window size). We will then run through the same 

Exploratory Data Analysis with our added predictions.
